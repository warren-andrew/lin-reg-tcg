# Price Regression Analysis on Trading Card Game Cards 

### Description
In this project, I analyze the price of cards from a trading card game based on the observable factors about the card.

### Target Variables
1. Selling price of individual trading cards
2. Features of demand for the card, including:
* the card's in-game attributes, operationalized by the cost to play the card, the card's type, and the number of effects contained within the card's description
* information about  the card's art and design (e.g. holographic, full-art, any 'wow' factors)
3. Features of supply for the card, including:
* Number of prints made for the card - may be proxied by the listed rarity of the card
4. Control variables accounting for the effect of time
* Release date
